Ball position: white

And it's a push win for white on A file.

Black cards revealed:
 0. jump
 1. wall [D]
 2. kamikaze
 3. knife
 X bishop
 5. tank
 X fire

Why not play wall on A5 instead of fire?

Fire leaves a free pawn for each player, but white plays first and ball position is at white - so white wins.

Scorer must know: if ball position is at the opponent then need to make sure opponent doesn't push to win.
